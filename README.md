# Getting Started with Create React App

This project is a single page application about my profile portfolio that has the following pages:
    - Home page
    - About Me page
    - Profile page
    - Projects page
    

### `software installed`

npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
npm i @fortaweome/free-brands-svg-icons
npm i @fortaweome/free-solid-svg-icons
npm i @fortaweome/react-fontawesome
npm i animate.css
npm i gsap-trail
npm i loaders.css

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:



### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.



### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
